solve_bitarray.c    # the c version of mapping numbers to bits.
solve_nmap_bitmap.c # the same bitmap trick, but reading with nmap!
solve_qsort.c       # sorting the array, print no duplicates
solve_sort.py       # sorting the array, print no duplicates
solve_set.py        # storing in a set
solve_set.lua       # storing in a set
perl -lne'exists $h{$_} or print $h{$_}=$_' # perl one-liner
